# What made you want to apply for this role?

I strive to continuously develop and become better, both professionally and
in my personal life. I have a mindset that there is always room for
improvement or something new to learn. After a couple of years in the
security industry I feel it’s time for new challenges. I’m really passionate
about cloud computing, designing/architecting infrastructure and automation
and that’s something I’d like to continue to work with. I have considerable
experience within cloud computing, especially AWS which make me a great fit
for this position.
