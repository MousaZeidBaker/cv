# Mousa Zeid Baker
Degree in Computer Science and Engineering

## About me
Extremely motivated to constantly develop my skills and grow professionally. I 
am confident in my ability to come up with interesting ideas where I can apply 
my technical knowledge and skills for continuous improvement. My interests lie 
primarily within the field of software development and artificial intelligence, 
specifically and machine learning and deep learning.


## Currently 

I'm a Software developer at [Axis Communications](http://www.axis.com/), based 
at their R&D site in Lund, Sweden. 

## Experience 

`2018-` __Axis Communications__ Software developer 

Developing cloud-based surveillance solution for security and alarm monitoring 
companies. The platform setup includes network video cameras and a variety of 
analytics and security devices solutions.

`2017` __Sony Mobile Communications__ Master's Degree Project 

The main goal of the thesis was to investigate how to use Generative 
Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic data in order to increase the 
number of training examples to train a classifier. GANs are neural networks 
that analyzes data from a certain distribution in order to generate similar 
data. A conditional DCGAN was implemented using TensorFlow, the convolutional 
neural network (CNN) classifier was pre- implemented with Caffe’s .prototxt 
format in NVIDIA DIGITS. 

`2016` __Ericsson Stockholm__ Internship 

Worked with deep learning within the department of Cloudplatform HDS. Various 
of deep learning frameworks such as Caffe, TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn, 
Torch etc were used. to model different types of artificial neural networks. 
From simple fully connected neural networks (NN) to recurrent neural networks (
RNN) for predicting utilization levels and failures in Data Center 
installations. 

## Education 

`2012-2018` __Blekinge Institute of Technology__ MSc in Computer Science and 
Engineering 

`2016` __Universitat Politècnica De Catalunya__ Exchange student in Barcelona, 
Spain through Erasmus programme for higher education students
