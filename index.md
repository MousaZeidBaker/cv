# Mousa Zeid Baker
Degree in Computer Science and Engineering

## About me
Extremely motivated to constantly develop my skills, increase my knowledge
and to grow professionally. I am confident in my ability to come up with
creative solutions and ideas where I can apply my technical knowledge and
skills. My primarily skills lie within the field of cloud computing, DevOps
and plain software development. I also have interest in artificial
intelligence, specifically machine learning and deep learning.

## Currently

I'm a Engineer at [Axis Communications](http://www.axis.com/), based at the
R&D New Business site in Lund, Sweden. My role includes, but is not limited
to, cloud computing, software development, DevOps and solution designing.

## Experience
`2020-` __Axis Communications__ Software Engineer & DevOps Engineer

Part of a new cloud-native serverless computing project within the field of
Audio. We started the project from scratch and the goal was to develop a
multi-site serverless solution. The solution can be used for voice messaging,
music streaming, warning system etc. The architecture of choice was
microservice-oriented with Pub/Sub pattern in order to ensure event-driven
architecture. The Serverless computing allowed our application to quickly
scale in response to demand.

`2018-2020` __Axis Communications__ Software Engineer

Developer with a cloud-based surveillance solution for security and alarm
monitoring companies called Guardian. The platform setup included network
video cameras and a variety of analytics and security devices. I had the time
to be part of two agile teams, one backend and one frontend, with a main
focus on the backend. With time I got an important role as an API specialist
where I had the opportunity to both design and implement JSON RESTful APIs.

`2017-2017` __Sony Mobile Communications__ Master's Degree Project

The main goal of the thesis was to investigate how to use Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic data in order to increase
the number of training examples to train a classifier. GANs are neural
networks that analyzes data from a certain distribution in order to generate
similar data. A conditional DCGAN was implemented using TensorFlow, the
convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier was pre- implemented with
Caffe’s .prototxt format in NVIDIA DIGITS.

`2016-2016` __Ericsson Stockholm__ Internship

Worked with deep learning within the department of Cloud platform HDS.
Various of deep learning frameworks such as Caffe, TensorFlow, Keras,
scikit-learn, Torch etc were used to model different types of artificial
neural networks. From simple fully connected neural networks (NN) to
recurrent neural networks (RNN) for predicting utilization levels and
failures in Data Center installations.

## Education

`2012-2018` __Blekinge Institute of Technology__ MSc in Computer Science and
Engineering

`2016-2016` __Universitat Politècnica De Catalunya__ Exchange student in Barcelona,
Spain through Erasmus programme for higher education students
